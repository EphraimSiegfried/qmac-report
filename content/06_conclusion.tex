\section*{Conclusion}

% Results are ok, could be better
% it's peer to peer which is nice
% a network protocol could be built on top of our protocol
The results of the QMAC protocol are satisfactory, though there is definitely room for improvement. The decentralized nature of the protocol is a strong point, making the network more robust and scalable. There's potential to build an even more advanced network protocol on top of what I've created. I'm proud to have developed this protocol on my own. Despite the challenges, this project has been a valuable learning experience.
